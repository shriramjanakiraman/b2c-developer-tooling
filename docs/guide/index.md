# Introduction

The B2C Developer Tooling provides command-line and AI-assisted development tools for Salesforce B2C Commerce.

- **B2C CLI**: Command-line interface that you can use to deploy code, manage sandboxes, run jobs, and so on from the terminal.
- **MCP Server**: AI-assisted development tools for Cursor, Claude Desktop, and other AI assistants.

## Quick CLI Install

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -g @salesforce/b2c-cli
```

```bash [npx]
npx @salesforce/b2c-cli --help
```

```bash [Homebrew]
brew install SalesforceCommerceCloud/tools/b2c-cli
```

:::

See the [CLI Installation Guide](./installation) for more installation options.

## Quick MCP Install

The B2C DX MCP Server enables AI assistants to help with B2C Commerce development tasks. Install it in your MCP client configuration:

**Cursor** (supports `${workspaceFolder}`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "b2c-dx": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@salesforce/b2c-dx-mcp", "--project-directory", "${workspaceFolder}", "--allow-non-ga-tools"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop** (use explicit path):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "b2c-dx": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@salesforce/b2c-dx-mcp", "--project-directory", "/path/to/your/project", "--allow-non-ga-tools"]
    }
  }
}
```

See the [MCP Server Installation Guide](/mcp/installation) for detailed setup instructions.
